## Tangram

Welcome! And thanks for your interest in learning more about [Tangram](https://mapzen.com/documentation/tangram/), a flexible mapping engine, designed for real-time rendering of 2D and 3D maps from vector tiles. Built around OpenStreetMap data, Tangram provides optional control over almost every aspect of the map-making process, including cartography, lighting, and geometry customization.

In this tutorial, we'll guide you through some of the basics of Tangram so that you can go ahead and create map visualizations on your own, feel confident enough to comprehend our [documentation site](https://mapzen.com/documentation/tangram/), or customize our map [house styles](https://mapzen.com/products/maps/). Don't worry about having too much or too little background knowledge. Some basic programming knowledge will be useful, but even beginner programmers can get started with Tangram.

We'll start by exploring how to build a very basic map, something like the following:

[section]
{ "type": "image", "width": "60%", "src": "min.png" }
[section]

And we'll build up to more complex maps, including the use of vector tiles to render updated, geographic data from around the world. By the way, the map below was generated with just 60 lines of code:

[section]
{ "type": "image", "width": "60%", "src": "complex.png" }
[section]

Neat right? We hope you find this tutorial useful. Please post any comments or feedback on our [GitHub page](https://github.com/tangrams/tangram-tutorial).
